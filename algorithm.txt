Calculate probabilities of symbols
	Construct nodes and put them in a minimum priority queue 

________________________________________
Construct huffman codes for each symbol
	= SymbolNode: (char, probability, boolean code)
	
	While pq not empty:
		Pop 2 nodes from pq
		Give 0, 1 for their codes
		Create new node with their prob's sum
		Assign the 2 nodes as left/right of new node
		Push new node in pq
	
	Traverse tree to acquire each symbol's code(store in a string)
		current = ""
		if (node.char != 0)
			map[node.char] = current + node.code.toString
